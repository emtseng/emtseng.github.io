            <p>
                I'm a Ph.D. student in the department of Information Science at Cornell University, based in NYC at Cornell Tech. I work with <a href="https://destrin.tech.cornell.edu/">Deborah Estrin</a>, <a href="https://www.nixdell.com/">Nicola Dell</a> and many others on the design and development of technologies that aim to improve healthcare and wellbeing for marginalized people. Lately I've been working on large-scale computational analysis of the language of online therapy; justice-oriented design of caregiving systems in home health; and computer security for victims and survivors of intimate partner violence.

            <p>
                I earned a B.A. from Princeton University and an M.S. from Cornell Tech. In previous lives I made radio,
                print
                and multimedia journalism, developed mathematical models for disease spread and ran early-stage product
                development at a tech startup. I've also worked as a healthcare consultant in the U.S. and taught
                software
                engineering. Drop me a line -- I'm always interested in meeting new people.
