  award: 🏆 Impact Recognition
  desc: Digital-safety research requires us to think deeply about difficult subjects, like hate and harassment, violence and war, abuse and tragedy. We explore how language technologies might help digital-safety researchers mitigate the secondary traumas possible in this work, and propose a set of design principles for trauma-informed qualitative research infrastructure more broadly.

Our discussions focused on articulating the frameworks, methodological gaps, and structural challenges that must be addressed to build a more rigorous and coordinated research agenda in this space. The report presents a detailed research roadmap for advancing responsible computing practices that better protect individuals who face heightened exposure to technology-facilitated harm."
