I went on the academic job market this past cycle (fall 2023 apps). I'm happy to report some very positive outcomes: I've accepted a tenure-track offer at the University of Washington's Department of Human-Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE), which I'm deferring to first do a postdoc at Microsoft Research with the Social Media Collective.

<!-- I wound up with 6 offers, for tenure-track Assistant Professor positions at departments across CS, Information, and Engineering. To get there, I submitted ~40 distinct applications. Of that, I had 19 first-round interviews, resulting in 14 invitations to on-sites. I declined 5 of those invitations. Of the 9 invitations that I accepted, 6 resulted in a department making me a TT offer. -->

This was a monumental effort, from myself and from my advisors, mentors, friends and family. I thought I was clued in to the hidden curricula of academia, but my god there was so much I didn't know. In the interest of paying it forward, I'll be using this series of blog posts to translate my experience into lessons and resources for future students, both mine and others'. This is an evolving document I hope to continue tending the further I get into my career.

## My materials

Buyer beware: I oriented my statements for the job market in CS, Information, and Engineering. This resulted in 6 offers for TT jobs at R1 U.S. universities, including departments of computer science and electrical and computer engineering, and interdisciplinary departments like information science and my future home at HCDE.

I'm feeling a little sensitive about my diversity statement at the moment. If you and I have connected before, I'd probably email it to you, but for now I'm going to keep it off the public Internet.

Similarly---my job talk contains some works-in-progress. Check back in a few weeks and hopefully I'll be able to make my slides available.
