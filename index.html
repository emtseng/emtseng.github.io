      Hi there!
    </p>
    <p>I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/">Information Science at Cornell
        University</a>, based
      in NYC at Cornell Tech. I'm very lucky to be advised primarily by <a href="https://www.nixdell.com/">Nicola Dell</a> and <a
        href="https://destrin.tech.cornell.edu/">Deborah Estrin</a>, with additional mentorship from <a href="https://rist.tech.cornell.edu/">Thomas Ristenpart</a>, <a href="https://www.karen-levy.net/">Karen E.C. Levy</a>, <a href="https://marylgray.org/">Mary L. Gray</a>, and many other collaborators. Currently, I am supported by a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/"></a>Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>tl;dr:</b> I study the role of computing in individual, interpersonal, and structural harms, and how to create more equitable tech. I use theories of social responsibility (e.g., feminism, trauma-informed care, participation) to reimagine how we design data-driven systems, and build and test alternatives in deep collaborations with affected communities.
      <!-- I'm interested in (a) understanding how the data-driven turn across the sciences is restructuring our infrastructures for care, creating novel risks to safety, privacy, health and well-being, and (b) designing alternative systems that reap the benefits of computation---scale, standardization---while mitigating its harms. -->
    </p>
    <p>
      <mark><b>I'm on the job market!</b></mark> I'll graduate from the PhD at Cornell Information Science in 2024. I'm open to TT faculty positions or research-oriented industry roles. My lab will explore how tenets of equity and social responsibility can be realized in computer science + engineering. If my work speaks to you, please get in touch!

      <b>Longer version:</b> <b>I create software systems, interventions, and design principles to reduce technology-mediated harm.</b> From stalking and online harassment to workplace surveillance and discrimination, digital technologies built to augment connection and creativity are increasingly weaponized to control, harass, and exploit the most vulnerable among us. Existing approaches to reducing these harms focus on empowering the people affected, by creating technology that improves their ability to overcome the harms they face. But whether expressed at the level of design processes or technological artifacts, empowering marginalized people through technology creates an essential tension: <b>how to equitably balance the benefits and burdens incurred by technological intervention.</b> When does technology help people overcome individual, community, and structural harms, and when does it instead further their marginalization? And how can technologists anticipate the answer to this question, to ensure technology truly enables human flourishing?
    </p>
    <p>
      I work at the intersection of <b>human-computer interaction (HCI)</b> and <b>computer security and privacy (S&P)</b> to explore these questions, by demonstrating and theorizing how to center safety and responsibility in computer science and engineering. I focus on high-stakes, multi-stakeholder contexts where digital systems play a central role in people's experiences of vulnerability. Through deep collaborations with affected communities, I map the social and technical ecosystems around these harms. I then develop frameworks for how to improve technology's impact in these ecosystems, grounded in theories of social responsibility (e.g., feminist ethics, trauma-informed care, participation). I use these frameworks to build systems and interventions that improve safety and well-being for those affected, and through this practice develop principles for safe and responsible design that are transferable across our rapidly evolving landscape of social change and technological innovation. In my PhD, I have applied this strategy to investigate <b></b>

      I publish at top-tier venues in HCI and social computing (ACM CHI, CSCW) and S&P (USENIX Security, IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy). Together with my amazing collaborators, students and mentors, I have earned 3 Best Paper Awards (top 1%), 1 Honorable Mention (top 5%), and third place in the 2020 Internet Defense Prize, as well as fellowships from Microsoft Research, Cornell IS, the Consortium for the Science of Sociotechnical Systems, and Rising Stars in EECS. 
      Our work has additionally been published in JAMA, a top-tier medical journal, and appeared at highly selective privacy conferences, including the Privacy Law Scholars Conference and the Reidenberg Northeast Privacy Scholars Workshop.

      In addition to advancing scholarly conversations around computing and design, my work centers real-world impact. I am part of the team building <a href="https://www.ceta.tech.cornell.edu/">the Clinic to End Tech Abuse (CETA)</a>, where my work has helped provide survivors of tech-enabled intimate partner violence with volunteer security and privacy support. CETA has served hundreds of survivors in the New York City area since 2018, and earned accolades from the New York City Mayor's Office to End Gender-Based Violence. With CETA, I have consulted on U.S. Senate legislation establishing legal protections for IPV survivors, resulting in the Safe Connections Act, signed into law in 2022. I have also been invited to share my work in industry, via talks at Microsoft, Meta, and Google. Most recently, I gave a keynote address at Google Trust & Safety's workshop on protecting at-risk users.

      Before this, I earned a B.A. from Princeton University in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB), a field-leading department in computational approaches to understanding the biological and social worlds. I focused on the epidemiology and control of infectious disease epidemics, and my undergraduate thesis earned the department's top prize in mathematical modeling. I also earned an M.S. from Cornell Tech in Health Tech, where I added graduate-level education in machine learning and HCI to my toolkit. In previous lives I made radio, print and multimedia journalism and ran early-stage product development at a consumer health tech startup. I've also worked as a healthcare consultant in the U.S. and taught software engineering.
