      Hi there!
    </p>
    <p>I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/">Information Science at Cornell
        University</a>, based
      in NYC at Cornell Tech. I'm very lucky to be advised primarily by <a href="https://www.nixdell.com/">Nicola Dell</a> and <a
        href="https://destrin.tech.cornell.edu/">Deborah Estrin</a>, with additional mentorship from <a href="https://rist.tech.cornell.edu/">Thomas Ristenpart</a>, <a href="https://www.karen-levy.net/">Karen E.C. Levy</a>, <a href="https://marylgray.org/">Mary L. Gray</a>, and many other collaborators. Currently, I am supported by a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/"></a>Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>tl;dr:</b> I study the role of computing in individual, interpersonal, and structural harms, and how to create more equitable tech. Working closely with affected communities, I use social theory to reimagine the principles and practices of computer science + engineering, and build and test systems enacting more socially responsible alternatives.
      <!-- I'm interested in (a) understanding how the data-driven turn across the sciences is restructuring our infrastructures for care, creating novel risks to safety, privacy, health and well-being, and (b) designing alternative systems that reap the benefits of computation---scale, standardization---while mitigating its harms. -->
    </p>
    <p>
      <mark><b>I'm on the job market!</b></mark> I'll graduate from the PhD at Cornell Information Science in 2024. I'm open to TT faculty positions or research-oriented industry roles. My lab will explore how tenets of equity and social responsibility can be realized in computer science + engineering. If my work speaks to you, please get in touch!

      <b>Longer version:</b> Increasingly, our efforts to improve people's lives involve gathering large amounts of data on their trauma or pain, analyzing it using machine learning methods increasingly less and less subject to human oversight, and then using that analysis to make design and policy decisions. I want us to be able to do this rigorously and with attention to core human values like privacy, agency, and equity. To me, this requires evolution in the principles and practices of how we build data-driven technologies. In my PhD thus far, I have worked specifically on computer security and privacy for survivors of intimate partner violence, worker-centered design for home care aides, and workplace surveillance and mental health. I have also spent time investigating how the technology industry can work with communities towards health equity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Methodologically, I build on techniques from human-computer interaction (HCI) and computational social science (CSS). I first investigate novel sources of harm, using large-scale analyses of social datasets and high-touch design research with impacted communities. Where appropriate, I mount interventions employing novel social and technical systems, and work with civil society to sustain them. Through rigorous empirical knowledge production, I work concurrently towards theoretical and practical interventions that can help address these harms upstream, at the level of technology design, law, and policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      My home field is HCI and social computing, and I maintain active footprints in computer security, medicine and public health, and privacy.
      Together with my amazing collaborators, students and mentors, I have earned best paper awards at CHI, CSCW, and USENIX Security. 
      Our work has additionally been published in JAMA, a top-tier medical journal, and appeared at highly selective privacy conferences, including the Privacy Law Scholars Conference and the Reidenberg Northeast Privacy Scholars Workshop.
      </p>
    <p>
      In addition to advancing scholarly conversations around computing and design, my work strives for real-world impact. I am part of the team building <a href="https://www.ceta.tech.cornell.edu/">the Clinic to End Tech Abuse (CETA)</a>, where my work has helped provide survivors of tech-enabled intimate partner violence with volunteer security and privacy support. CETA has served hundreds of survivors in the New York City area since 2018, and earned accolades from the New York City Mayor's Office to End Gender-Based Violence. With CETA, I have consulted on U.S. Senate legislation establishing legal protections for IPV survivors. I have also been invited to share my work in industry, via talks at Microsoft, Meta, and Google. Most recently, I gave a keynote address at Google Trust & Safety's workshop on protecting at-risk users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this, I earned a B.A. from Princeton University in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB), a field-leading department in computational approaches to understanding the biological and social worlds. I focused on the epidemiology and control of infectious disease epidemics, and my undergraduate thesis earned the department's top prize in mathematical modeling. I also earned an M.S. from Cornell Tech in Health Tech, where I added graduate-level education in machine learning and HCI to my toolkit. In previous lives I made radio, print and multimedia journalism and ran early-stage product development at a consumer health tech startup. I've also worked as a healthcare consultant in the U.S. and taught software engineering.
