    Hi there!
  </p>
  <p>I'm currently a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/">Information Science at Cornell University</a>, based
    in NYC at Cornell Tech. I'm advised primarily by <a href="https://www.nixdell.com/">Nicola Dell</a> and <a
      href="https://destrin.tech.cornell.edu/">Deborah Estrin</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I design and build sociotechnical systems that help us care for each other. Lately I've been working on large-scale
    computational analysis of the language of online therapy; justice-oriented design of caregiving systems in home
    health; and computer security for victims and survivors of intimate partner violence. More fundamentally, I'm
    interested in mitigating the harms caused by technocratic largesse through feminist approaches to the design and
    development of computing systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    I earned a B.A. from Princeton University in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, focusing on epidemiological modeling for global health. I also earned an M.S. from Cornell Tech in Health Tech. In previous lives I made radio,
    print
    and multimedia journalism and ran early-stage product
    development at a consumer health tech startup. I've also worked as a healthcare consultant in the U.S. and taught
    software
    engineering.
